## Agile Methodology
GitHub Projects was used to manage the development process using the agile approach. To ensure streamlined organization, all User Stories were grouped into Milestones, representing the corresponding Epics, following the MOSCOW prioritization technique. For a comprehensive overview of the project's progress and workflow, I invite you to explore our dynamic Kanban board. [here](https://github.com/users/MBilalQureshi/projects/8).

The user stories seen above are based on the items mentioned on the project board.
